        <h1>Mapo Tofu Recipe</h1>
        <img src="./mapo-tofu.jpg">
        <p>A favorite of mine, a mouth-watering spicy dish that uses tofu and ground pork.
            It is an iconic dish known for its red sauce and mala flavor. You will need a variety 
            of ingredients but it will be well worth it in the end.
