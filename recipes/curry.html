        <img src ="./curry.webp">
        <p>Japanese curry is an imported product from the British colonies. Modern curry
            is actually super convenient. Bordering on stew, this is a highly customizable dish.
            The most important ingredient is the curry roux block which can be purchased at almost
            any large grocery store nowadays.
